This is the [InfoSyncServices](https://github.com/grantrobertsmith/InfoSyncServices) iPhone Personal Data Store (PDS) application. For a broader perspective on the utility of a PDS, please see the [InfoSyncServices wiki](https://github.com/grantrobertsmith/InfoSyncServices/wiki). A PDS provides users with a secure way to save any infromation about themselves that they desire. Standards for commonly standardized data should be used when it makes sense and other data should be stored either in a documented format or in bulk.
